  <h2> My Project Idea </h2>

  <h3> Overview</h3>
  <p align="justify">My IT project idea is to create a web application for
  discovering public parks and areas around your locality for exercising.
  On this app, users will post new parks but also review other user-submitted
  places. Users will also submit information about each park, such as amenities,
  exercising or play equipment, their condition and upload pictures for all the
  other users to see the park for themselves. The web app will offer
  flexibility to be opened from any device with only a browser and an internet
  connection. It will ensure that users with any devices can quickly look up or
  submit places directly from their smartphones without downloading any other
  applications. With integration with Google Maps API, they can promptly get
  directions to get to the desired park to get exercise without any delays!</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p align="justify">During the lockdown, one of the things that I have enjoyed
  doing was visiting my local parks when I had the opportunity to exercise
  outdoors. Unfortunately, as I was a new resident of this suburb, I was
  unaware of many smaller parks and green areas found in the region. I would
  often discover them by chance when taking my daily walks or looking up
  places on Google maps to see anything nearby.  I realised quickly that
  Google Maps did not describe each park and its amenities unless a user had
  taken the time to write a detailed review. It would usually take me some
  time to go through multiple pages of reviews before finding the required
  information. By then, I realised scrolling on my phone while sitting down
  on my couch was a lot more comfortable! If I had a web app built for this
  specific purpose and containing the relevant information, I would be more
  efficient at finding these new places and deciding if they would be
  appropriate for me. Looking further into it, I have found a 23% increase in
  the utilisation of parks at a National level compared to pre-covid numbers
  (Infrastructure Australia 2020). It meant that I was not the only person in
  this situation.</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p align="justify">This web app will be accessible by entering its URL into
  a web browser.  The app will allow users to perform multiple tasks as
  listed below</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Searching for nearby Parks</li>
  <li>Creating an account</li>
  <li>Adding a new park</li>
  <li>Reviewing parks</li>
  <li>Adding pictures</li>
  <li>Reporting incorrect information</li>
  </ul>

  <p align="justify">One of the primary functions of the web app will be to
  allow users to find parks in their area by entering their postcodes or
  allowing the app to locate them. The web app will compare the user's
  location against a database of parks submitted by other users to provide a
  list of suggestions based on distance from them. Each park's page will
  have a description of the park with pictures submitted by other users. Once
  the user has found a park he is interested in, he can also obtain navigation
  directions to the park. This feature will make heavy use of a geolocation or
  navigation platform such as Google Maps Platform. I can use the geolocation
  feature of the platform to locate the device precisely, and then the routes
  feature to present the user with the quickest way to the park.</p>

  <p align="justify">Users will require to create an account with their email
  address and log in to post content and reviews. It will ensure that the
  content they posted can be traced back to the user if required. Users will
  not need to log in to view content or do searches. To manage the account
  creation, I can use an online member management service like Memberstack or
  Memberspace that allows users to sign up and sign in securely.</p>

  <p align="justify">When a user wishes to submit a new park, they will be
   required to enter the below information to ensure that every new submission
   has a decent level of information to help other users:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Name of the park</li>
  <li>Address (can also make use of the geolocation platform)</li>
  <li>Pictures</li>
  <li>Description of the amenities and their condition </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Kiosks</li>
    <li>Seating areas</li>
    <li>Barbecue stations</li>
    <li>Drinking fountains</li>
    <li>Restrooms</li>
    <li>Running/walking track</li>
    <li>Outdoor exercising equipment</li>
    <li>Kid’s playground</li>
    <li>Dogs off-leash areas</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p align="justify">Users who have created an account and signed in will also
  be able to post reviews of parks. As part of their review, users will have to
   rate the park and amenities to ensure the content is as current as possible.
    The web app will use a star rating system (1 to 5 stars) where required.</p>

  <p align="justify">Users will also have a function to upload their images of
  the park. This feature will be only possible after they have signed in with
  an account. Pictures uploaded to the web app will need to be approved by an
  admin to ensure that the images submitted are safe to be viewed by other
  users. The web app will provide clear guidelines around the below topics
  before users submit any pictures:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Copyright violations</li>
  <li>Privacy and Safety issues</li>
  <li>Obscene images</li>
  <li>Off-topic images</li>
  </ul>

  <p align="justify">If a user finds information that is not correct, they
  will have the facility to report it and send suggested amendments. These can
  be anything from incorrect information about the park (for example, park
    address or description) or inaccurate pictures. The data will be submitted
    to an admin to review before any information is changed.</p>

  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
  <p align="justify">The four main components of the web app will be the</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Front-end – this is the interface that users will see and interact with.
  I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the app interface.</li>
  <li>Back-end – all the coding that makes the web app functionalities work.
  I will require to use a back-end language such as Python, Ruby or PHP.</li>
  <li>Database – where all the information is stored. A relational database
  like MySQL or PostgreSQL will need to be implemented to store data</li>
  <li>Server – where the web app is hosted and accessed from when users run
  it. I will need to set up a server via a service like Google Cloud or Amazon
  Web Services.</li>
  </ul>

  <p align="justify">Another more minor component used is the Google Maps
  Platform to offer geolocation and navigation services. Finally, to manage
  user accounts, I could use an open-source tool like MemberPrism to reduce the
  amount of coding required for account creation and management. </p>

  <h3>Skills required</h3>
  <p align="justify">In terms of technical skill required, software and web
  development will be essential to this project. It will be helpful to have a
  good understanding of both front-end and back-end languages with additional
  working knowledge of setting up a database and server. Learning HTML,
  CSS and Javascript will be needed to put together the app's interface.
  As I am currently learning Python in my "Introduction to Programming" class,
  it will most likely be used to code the back-end provided it can fulfil all
  the required functions and features. The back-end will also need to be
  configured to work with the different APIs of the additional services,
  such as Google Maps or MemberPrism.</p>

  <p align="justify">Problem-solving,  decisiveness and self-motivation
  will be the leading soft skills to bring this project to completion. As I
  will be working on a new solution that doesn't already exist with tools
  I haven't used previously, there will be many new challenges to overcome.
  My commitment to the goal will help motivate me when going these challenges
  arise. Problem-solving using technical skills will be essential to developing
  the app and ensuring the code is working correctly. Decisiveness will ensure
   that I am not spending valuable time making a necessary decision while still
   making the right choice</p>

  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p align="justify">Once the app is ready, I intend to launch it as a
  trial amongst relatives and friends to ensure that all the features required
  have been implemented and obtain feedback on what could be changed. The app
  should allow us to find new parks and get a clear description of their
  amenities. It will help us decide where to go for our next run, walk or
  picnic. Following this, I would be looking at making the web app more known
  via social media to reach a wider audience and help everyone who has been
  experiencing the outdoors more over the past year.<p><br><br>

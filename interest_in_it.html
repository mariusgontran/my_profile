  <h2> My Interest in IT </h2>

  <h3> My Interest in IT</h3>
  <p align="justify">One of the most enjoyable parts of my career has been
  using my problem-solving skills whenever faced with a challenge. However,
  I have often found that my ability to resolve issues were limited by the
  function of the tools I had access to at the time. Therefore, my interest in
  IT grew more and more every time I faced these situations where I knew that
  either another tool could do the job better or that it is entirely possible
  to create the right tool for the task with the right skills.</p>

  <br><h3> When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
  <p align="justify">Like most people nowadays, I was exposed to computers from
  a very young age. To entertain myself, I would spend long hours sitting down
  at my desk and using different applications to see what they could do and
  playing any computer games I would come across. As a result, I grew up seeing
  multiple technologies implemented in the IT world, and I witnessed how we all
  changed our interactions with computers to reach where we are today. From the
  adoption of smartphones and social media to the various IT solutions
  implemented in most industries, there has been a massive shift in using
  computers in our daily lives. I am delighted to have been following this since
  I was young.</p>

  <br><h3> A particular event that sparked my interest</h3>
  <p align="justify">One of the main events that encouraged me to pursue my
  studies in IT was my involvement with a significant system overhaul that
  happened while I was working for a large retailer in their supply chain
  department. The system overhaul introduced multiple new applications to work
  with our current systems. I was very interested in watching how the IT
  engineering team first mapped out how all the existing applications worked
  and how users would use them in real-life scenarios. Then, they analysed the
  best solutions and consulted us before going ahead and putting in place the
  new applications and the accompanying reworked processes. I was amazed at how
  they worked in a team to make this whole experience as painless as possible
  for the users while working in the background to program the required software
  and APIs to ensure all would work seamlessly once in place. It showed me how
  it becomes much easier to respond to these challenges with the right skills
  and IT tools.</p>

  <br><h3> Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p align="justify">After comparing the various IT undergraduate degrees offered
  in Melbourne and speaking with relatives and friends at multiple universities,
  I decided to apply to RMIT to complete my Bachelor of IT via Open Universities.
  I preferred to study online as it offered complete flexibility with my current
  work and social arrangements while receiving education recognised by the
  industry.</p>

  <br><h3> What I expect to learn during my studies</h3>
  <p align="justify">With completing my Bachelor, I will obtain skills that will
  allow me to become an IT Professional with expertise in various disciplines.
  With my first two subjects, Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming,
  I will be taking the first steps in learning the fundamentals to achieve my
  goal. In addition, Introduction to IT will show me a range of IT fields,
  programs and competencies required to start my IT career (RMIT n.d.).
  Meanwhile, in Introduction to Programming, I will be learning the essentials
  parts of programming and how to think in step-by-step to resolve a problem then
  matching this to a program (RMIT n.d.). In the rest of the course, I will learn
  to further develop my knowledge in IT and learn more about other interesting
  IT areas.</p><br><br>

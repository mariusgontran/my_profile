  <h2> My Ideal Job</h2>

  <br>I have presented below an example of an ideal job for me. The position
  is for a Senior Software developer for JB Hi-Fi.<br>

  <br><h3>Description of the position</h3>
  <p align=justify>I would be working as part of a team to develop software and
  other solutions for the retail chain JB HI-FI in this position. The main task
  of this job would be using programming to fix issues or create new solutions
  for all parties involved with the company; this would include improving
  existing applications and developing new ones for staff or customers to use.
  I would be involved with applications at different stages of their life cycles,
  pre and post-release, to ensure. This job appeals to me as it would make direct
  use of my passion for solving complex problems.  Having worked with JB
  previously, I have enjoyed the company culture and have witnessed the team
  spirit that all departments can show when working. The different IT teams
  appeared to be cohesive and having a solid bond to achieve their common
  goals.</p>

  <h3>Qualifications and Skills required</h3>
  <p align=justify>While the ad does not mention it, I believe that a minimum
  of an IT Degree is needed for this position as it would offer you exposition
  to the base of the technical requirements. The primary skill required would
  be to know various programming languages but, more importantly, C# and Node.js,
  as mentioned in the ad. There are also requirements to understand multiple
  technologies such as cloud computing with exposition to Amazon Web Services
  and Microsoft Azure, which are currently the US's two most extensive cloud
  computing services (Canalys 2021). The ad also focuses on an event-driven
  architecture for their applications, so it will be advantageous to have
  experience with systems where monitoring events as triggers happens.
  It will be essential to know the different software development strategies
  such as Test-driven Development (TDD) and, subsequently, Behaviour-driven
  Development (BDD). Another critical part of the requirements is familiarity
  with relational databases for storing information and document databases.
  For soft skills, having good problem-solving abilities and being a solid
  team player would be essential to be successful in this position.</p>

  <h3>My Current Qualifications and Skills</h3>
  <p align=justify>As I haven't previously worked in the IT department, I,
  unfortunately, do not have the required technical skills to apply for this
  role. However, during my career, I have developed all the necessary character
  traits required. Being naturally introverted, I have worked hard to
  communicate openly in professional settings when needed. I have worked in
  different types of teams and understand that flexibility and adaptability
  are at the core of ensuring success for the team. My experience in the
  logistics industry has allowed me to demonstrate my problem-solving
  skills daily.</p>

  <h3>How I will obtain the required qualifications</h3>
  <p align=justify>As I already possess the primary soft skills and teamwork
  experience required, the main requirement I will be working on will be the
  technical qualifications over the next few years. I first intend to complete
  my Bachelor of IT with a particular focus on mastering various programming
  languages. I will also select subjects that will offer me exposure to the
  rest of the technical requirements, such as databases, software development,
  and cloud computing. As this is a Senior position, I may have to find
  employment in Junior positions first to gain the necessary work experience
  as a software developer.</p><br><br><br>

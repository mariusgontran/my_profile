  <h3>Myers-Briggs Test Results</h3>
  <p align="justify">I completed the Myers-Briggs Test on

  the results of my Myers-Briggs test was ISTP which means I have the following
  personality traits as described in Figure 1 (16personalities.com): </p>

  </figure>
  <p align="justify">The ISTP personality type is the kind of person who enjoys
  being internally inquisitive about everything and disassembling things to
  rebuild them better. They are excellent problem-solvers even when the
  challenge seems impossible and have an avidness to explore new skills and
  areas of personal growth. </p>

  The complete test results are available on below link:

  <h3>Learning Style Test Results</h3>
  <p align="justify">After completing the Learning Style Test on
  <a href="https://www.learning-styles-online.com/inventory/questions.php">
  www.learning-styles-online.com</a>, I have found that I had a Visual learning
  style. It refers to my preference for using images and diagrams to assimilate
  information better and communicate with others.</p>

  More details of my results are on the following link:

  <h3>Big Five Personality Test Results</h3>
  <p align="justify">I completed the Big Five Personality Test on
  <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">
  www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test</a>, which measures five
  personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness,
  and Neuroticism and obtained the results show in Figure 2(Truity.com):</p>

    <figcaption> Fig.2 - My Big Five Personality test result, <i>truity.com</i>
      </figure>
    

  <p align="justify">According to this test, my main personality trait is
  agreeableness. It reflects my patterns of favouring teamwork rather than
  competition. This trait also shows a high level of empathy and being aware
  of the emotions around me.</p>

  The detailed results are available on the link below:
  <br><a href="https://www.truity.com/test-results/bigfive/17315/17351900">
  https://www.truity.com/test-results/bigfive/17315/17351900</a>

  <br><h3>What do these test results mean?</h3>
  <p align="justify">While some of the traits from the different test
  contradict themselves, they are vital points to which I can relate and agree.
  For example, there is no arguing that I am naturally more introverted, as
  described by both the Myers-Briggs and the Big Five Personality test results.
  I also tend to make decisions more rationally based on facts and analysis
  rather than on my intuition or feelings alone, as shown in the Myers-Briggs
  test results. The prospecting trait in these results also correctly shows how
  flexible I can be with dealing with unexpected challenges, enhancing my
  problem-solving skills.  Knowing that I have a visual learning style will
  help me choose the best way to take in information when required and
  understand my most robust method of communication.</p>

  <h3>How will these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
  <p align="justify">I believe my agreeableness will have a very positive
  effect on any teamwork requiring done. I enjoy helping others achieve the
  best they can as much as myself doing it. The openness trait brings
  creativity that is often needed when facing new challenges, while
  conscientiousness will help me exercise the self-motivation required to
  meet the team's deadlines. Though I scored low on extraversion, this is
  an area where I make conscious efforts to improve communicating with others
  when required, as I am fully aware that not doing so will only be adverse to
  the team. </p>

  <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  <p align="justify">When forming the team, these results will help us
  determine our overall strengths and weaknesses. We will take the time to
  compare our results and identify the key areas where we do not have
  complimentary qualities to ensure we develop those throughout our group work.
  It will be an excellent opportunity for all members to work side-by-side to
  either share their trait or work towards improving certain areas together.</p>
